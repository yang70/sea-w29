Unix & Git for Everyone
-----------------------

### Pre-work

##### 1. Ensure your laptop up to the task of coding

  - Is virus and malware free
  - Uses the latest, stable, updated version of its operating system
  - Has a functioning screen, keyboard, and trackpad
  - Has plenty of free hard drive space and memory
  - Can reliably connect to wireless networks

##### 2. Complete the "Console Foundations" and the "Git Basics" online courses

  - http://teamtreehouse.com/library/console-foundations-2
  - http://teamtreehouse.com/library/git-basics

**TIP:** Treehouse offers a free 14-day trial which you can suspend after completing their courses.

##### 3. Complete the setup guide for your computer's operating system

  - [Mac OS X](prework/mac/1_terminal.md)
  - [Ubuntu](prework/ubuntu/1_terminal.md)
  - [Windows](prework/windows/1_terminal.md)

### Assignment

At the workshop, you'll learn all the skills necessary to complete this assignment. It's due before the start of your follow-up Code Fellows course.

Demonstrate the following skills using **only** your Terminal, your text editor, and your web browser.

##### 1. Create a fork of this repository

##### 2. Clone the fork to your computer

##### 3. Create a new branch called `notes`

##### 4. Checkout the branch `notes`

##### 5. Create a directory with the same name as your GitHub username

For example, `codefellows`

##### 6. Create a `unix_notes.txt` file in this directory

For example, `codefellows/unix_notes.txt`

##### 7. Add the notes about what you've learned about Unix to this file

For example,

```
cd <path> Changes the working directory to <path>
ls <path> Lists the directory content of <path>
...
```

##### 8. Create a `git_notes.txt` file in this directory

For example, `codefellows/git_notes.txt`

##### 9. Add the notes about what you've learned about Git to this file

For example,

```
git add <file> Adds any changes inside <file> to the staging area
git commit -m '<message>' Commits the staging area to the repository with a <message>
...
```

##### 10. Add these untracked files to the staging area

##### 11. Commit the changes

##### 12. Push the branch to the `origin` remote on GitHub

##### 13. Send a pull request from this branch to Code Fellows' `master` branch

What contributed most to your learning?
Being able to get direct and instant feedback to questions or problems.  Also being able to see examples and know that this is the correct way to do things, rather than doing it your own way and wondering if it is correct.

What was the least helpful to your learning?
Least helpful for me personally was that we spend most of the class going over things I had already learned by doing the pre-work, and the end of the class when we started going over things that I was learning for the first time it was a bit rushed and we were not able to delve into it as much or ask questions (collaboration and pull requests).  I understand though that the focus of the class was the basics and getting started, so that was expected.
Would you recommend this workshop to a friend (0-10)?
8 - I would definitely recommend this to a friend if they are a beginner at UNIX and Git, however if they already have some experience with those things I would tell them it most likely is not necessary.
